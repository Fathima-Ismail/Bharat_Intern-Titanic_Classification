# Bharat_Intern-Titanic_Classification

This is a repository made for Bharat Intern's second task, in which a machine learning model has to be developed which tells whether the person will be saved from sinking or not using the Titanic Dataset.

To get complete dataset of people who boarded in titanic on the day of disaster, I combined three datasets that I downloaded from kaggle and made it as one single dataset [Titanic Dataset (Complete)]. I have uploaded this dataset for easy reference.

However, you can find all the three original datasets used in kaggle:

gender_submission.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=gender_submission.csv

test.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=test.csv

train.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv
